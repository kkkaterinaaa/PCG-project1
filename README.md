# Scary fractal forest
Game level design project that uses procedural content generation algorithms to dynamically create eerie and atmospheric 2D levels. The project was developed as part of an exploration of procedural generation techniques, and it leverages two main algorithms: Perlin Noise for generating a road network and Fractal Tree Generation for creating spooky, natural-looking trees.
